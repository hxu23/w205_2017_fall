Instructions:

Week 5
loading_and_modeling folder contains all the scripts to download and store into Hive the data from the Hospitals Compare database

Week 6
transforming folder contains a notebook use for exploratory data analysis. The notebook plugs into pyspark and loads all the tables. It explains the motivation behind the transformations that are made.

Week 7
investigations folder contains all results. There are individual notebooks that show the work done to arrive at the results and then the .py files contain the scripts to execute and display output.
