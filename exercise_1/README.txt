Instructions:

Week 5
loading_and_modeling folder contains all the scripts to download and store into Hive the data from the Hospitals Compare database

Week 6
The exploratory_data_analysis notebook was used to investigate the transformations used in the transforming folder. The notebook plugs into pyspark and loads all the tables with explanations on the motivation behind each transformation.

Week 7
investigations folder contains all results. There are individual notebooks that show the work done to arrive at the results and then the .py files contain the scripts to execute and display output.

The final question of comparing patient survey results against hospital rating and procedure variability has a notebook with some visualizations of the relationships. The hospital_and_patients.py file outputs the actual correlations
